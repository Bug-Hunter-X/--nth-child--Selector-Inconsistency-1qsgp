The problem might be caused by other selectors that are overriding the style. 
To address this, ensure that the specificity of your `:nth-child` selector is high enough to override any conflicting styles. You can use more specific selectors or increase the specificity with the `!important` flag as a last resort (though this is generally discouraged).

Here's a possible solution focusing on specificity, assuming your list elements have a class of 'list-item':

```css
.parent-container .list-item:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.parent-container .list-item:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: lightpink;
}
```

Consider restructuring the HTML for clearer styling if other methods fail.  Ensure that the `:nth-child` selector is applied correctly and that there are no conflicting or more specific styles overriding it.

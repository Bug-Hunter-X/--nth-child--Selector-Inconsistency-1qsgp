# :nth-child Selector Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a problem with the `:nth-child` CSS selector not consistently applying styles to every other element in a list.  The bug is reproduced in `bug.css`, and a potential solution is provided in `bugSolution.css`.

The issue occurs when applying styles to elements within a complex structure.  It might stem from incorrect nesting, parent selectors, or interactions with JavaScript.  The solution explores possible fixes to address this problem.
